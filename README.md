# GlomoPay employee-assistant

A NestJS Slack bot that answers employee questions using an LLM (via an OpenAI-compatible
AI gateway), web search (SearXNG), and read-only MCP tools (GitHub, Atlassian/Jira, Sentry).

The app and SearXNG ship in a single Docker image: SearXNG runs on `127.0.0.1:8080` inside the
container and the app talks to it there. One container runs both processes.

## Run locally (Docker)

Prereqs: Docker + Docker Compose. (Node 22 / pnpm 10 only needed for non-Docker dev.)

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then fill in the values below, INCLUDING SEARXNG_SECRET
pnpm docker:up            # docker compose up --build
```

- App: http://localhost:51515 (`GET /` returns a hello string — also the health check path)
- SearXNG JSON API: http://localhost:8080/search?q=test&format=json (exposed for debugging only)

Stop with `pnpm docker:down`.

`docker-compose.yml` bind-mounts `searxng/settings.yml` read-only, so you can edit SearXNG
config and restart without rebuilding.

## Environment variables

Set these in `.env` locally and as `sync: false` dashboard values on Render.

AI gateway (required):
- `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
- `AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL`
- `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL`

Slack (required — the bot receives events via webhooks, so the service must be public):
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
- `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`, `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` — only if your Slack app config needs them

MCP tools (read-only integrations):
- `GITHUB_PAT` (+ optional `GITHUB_MCP_URL`)
- `ATLASSIAN_EMAIL`, `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN` (+ optional `ATLASSIAN_MCP_URL`)
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` (+ optional `SENTRY_MCP_URL`)

SearXNG:
- `SEARXNG_SECRET` (required) — SearXNG reads this natively and overrides `secret_key`. If it is
  unset in production, SearXNG's boot guard exits with an error rather than running with a weak
  secret, so it must be set.
- `SEARXNG_BASE_URL` — full URL to the in-container SearXNG. Always `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
  (set by compose and render.yaml; you don't set it in `.env`).

`PORT` is injected by the platform (Render) and set to `51515` locally by compose — do not
hardcode it in code.

Note: `REDIS_HOST` / `REDIS_PORT` are no longer used (Redis/BullMQ was removed). Leftover values
in `.env` are harmless.

## Deploy to Render

The repo ships a `render.yaml` blueprint: one public Docker web service in Singapore
(`starter` plan, kept warm for Slack webhooks), running both the app and SearXNG.

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Render: New → Blueprint, connect the repo. Render reads `render.yaml`.
3. At first sync, fill every `sync: false` secret — including `SEARXNG_SECRET`.
4. Deploy. Confirm `/` health passes, then mention the bot in Slack and verify a
   web-search-backed answer (proves the in-container SearXNG on `127.0.0.1:8080` works).

## Non-Docker dev

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run start:dev
```

You'll need a SearXNG reachable at `SEARXNG_BASE_URL` and all env vars above set in your shell
or `.env`.

## Tests

```bash
pnpm test         # unit
pnpm test:e2e     # e2e
pnpm test:cov     # coverage
```
